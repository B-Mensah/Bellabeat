Bellabeat Case study

In this case study, I am working as a junior data analyst for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.


Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I have been asked to focus on Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.
